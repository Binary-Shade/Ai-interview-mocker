You cut me off in traffic—cool move, dumbass!
Then had the audacity to yell out "Learn to drive fast!"
You stole my fries, then licked ‘em just to claim,
I hope your Wi-Fi’s always one bar and lame.
[PRE-CHORUS]

You’re the human equivalent of a parking ticket,
A screaming baby on a 6 AM flight—you’re wicked.
Your personality’s a mix of spam calls and wet socks,
And your breath smells like a landfill on hot rocks.
[CHORUS]

OHHH, YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE! (The worst kind, yeah!)
The type who claps at movies like a seal at the pier!
YEAH, YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE! (No redeeming traits!)
You probably cheat at Uno then blame it on fate!
[VERSE 2]

You "borrowed" my charger—now it’s mysteriously gone,
You ghost the group chat but still tag along.
You microwave fish in the office like a war crime,
And laugh when your toilet paper roll’s empty every time.
[BRIDGE]

I’d say "Go to hell", but you’d complain it’s too hot,
Demand speak to Satan’s manager like the Karen you are.
So here’s my last middle finger, now go get bent,
This song’s over—just like my patience, THE END.
